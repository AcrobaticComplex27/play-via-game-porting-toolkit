Steps:
1. Download Xcode Command Line Tools (CLT) and Game Porting Toolkit (GPT).
Login your Apple ID in a browser. Go to https://developer.apple.com/download/all then search and download the .dmg files.
Tested version: CLT 15.1, GPT 1.1
File names: Command_Line_Tools_for_Xcode_15.1.dmg and Game_Porting_Toolkit_1.1.dmg

2. Open Command_Line_Tools_for_Xcode_15.1.dmg to install.

3. Install Rosetta and x86_64 Homebrew.
In Terminal:
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
arch -x86_64 zsh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

4. Use prebuild formula to install Game Porting Toolkit. Credit goes to gcenx.
In Terminal:
brew tap gcenx/homebrew-apple
brew install gcenx/wine/game-porting-toolkit
brew upgrade gcenx/wine/game-porting-toolkit

5. Mount Game_Porting_Toolkit_1.1.dmg by double clicking it in Finder.

6. Copy the lib directory from the mount to the compiled Game Porting Toolkit directory.
In Terminal:
rsync --archive \
  '/Volumes/Game Porting Toolkit-1.1/redist/lib' \
  '/usr/local/opt/game-porting-toolkit'

Below I am not using any Wine prefix. By default the game will be installed to a hidden directory ~/.wine
In Finder you can press Command+Shift+Dot to show hidden files.

7. Configure Wine.
In Terminal:
wine64 winecfg

Under Application tab, change Windows Version to Windows 10. Click Apply.
Under Graphics tab, change screen resolution to native. Mine is 224 dpi.
Click Apply and OK.

8. Download the game installer and open it through Wine.
File name: GenshinImpact_install_ua_1c7f03a4e655.exe
In Terminal:
WINEESYNC=1 wine64 ~/Downloads/GenshinImpact_install_ua_1c7f03a4e655.exe

Go through the process to install the game launcher. Then open the launcher in Japanese locale and start downloading the game. Since 1/4 of the game is audio, later I won’t have to download another audio pack.
In terminal:
WINEESYNC=1 LC_ALL=ja_JP.UTF-8 wine64 'C:\Program Files\Genshin Impact\launcher.exe'

9. After download, close launcher first. Edit registry.
In Terminal:
wine64 regedit

In ‘HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine’, right click to add key. Name it to ‘Mac Driver’.
Then in Mac Driver, right click to add string value. Name it ‘RetinaMode’.
Right click on RetinaMode, click modify, set value data to ‘Y’.

(Need to do this every time before launch, or it will snap back to lower resolution.)
In ‘HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\miHoYo\Genshin Impact’, modify ‘Screenmanager Resolution Height_h**********’ and ‘Screenmanager Resolution Width_h*********’ to native height and width respectively. Mine is 1864 and 2880 in decimal.
Close the window.

10. Launch the game.
In Terminal:
WINEESYNC=1 wine64 'C:\Program Files\Genshin Impact\launcher.exe'

11. After login, click Esc then the gear icon for settings. Now you can change the game language and graphics settings. Mine is 60fps, no v-sync, 0.6 render resolution, others low.

Result: Game is playable but with some stutters. Not worth my effort. But for other Windows games the procedure is similar.
